XRDP cant Login

https://askubuntu.com/questions/773626/xrdp-login-failed


I managed to fix this problem by editing the /etc/xrdp/sesman.ini file and commenting out the requirement to group membership. Now you can access all accounts.

[Security]
AllowRootLogin=1
MaxLoginRetry=4
#TerminalServerUsers=tsusers
#TerminalServerAdmins=tsadmins
